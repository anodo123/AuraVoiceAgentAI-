# AuraVoiceAgentAI

## Description

**AuraVoiceAgentAI** is an agentic IVR (Interactive Voice Response) assistant leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) and Generative AI to fully automate call center interactions. This project aims to build a Proof of Concept (POC) / Minimum Viable Product (MVP) demonstrating the core capabilities of an AI system that can understand natural language, engage in meaningful conversations, and execute tasks, with the ultimate goal of completely replacing human agents for defined call center use cases.

**Core Technologies (for MVP):**
* Python
* FastAPI
* Large Language Models (e.g., OpenAI, Anthropic via LiteLLM)
* Speech-to-Text (STT) services (e.g., Google Cloud STT)
* Text-to-Speech (TTS) services (e.g., Google Cloud TTS)
* Telephony integration (e.g., Twilio)

## Project Goal

To develop an intelligent IVR system that can:
1.  Understand caller intent through natural spoken language.
2.  Engage in context-aware, multi-turn conversations.
3.  Autonomously perform actions and resolve queries (initially via mock backends).
4.  Provide a seamless and efficient alternative to human call center agents for a specific set of functionalities.

## Current Stage
Starting development of the POC (Phase 1).
